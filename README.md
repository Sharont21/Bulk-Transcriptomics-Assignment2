# Introduction

During biological wine aging, flor yeast form a biofilm (velum) at the surface of the wine that drives many of the biochemical changes affecting wine composition and sensory properties [1]. In the absence of fermentable sugars, flor yeasts undergo substantial metabolic reprogramming, shifting from fermentative to oxidative metabolism and relying on ethanol and glycerol as primary carbon sources while utilizing poor nitrogen sources under stressful conditions, including high ethanol concentrations, oxidative stress, and nutrient limitation [1,2]. Velum formation represents a key adaptive trait, enabling yeast cells to access oxygen at the wine surface while providing protection from environmental stressors [1]. This process is regulated in part by increased expression of genes such as FLO11, which enhances cell-surface hydrophobicity and promotes multicellular aggregation, allowing yeast cells to migrate to the surface and form a stable biofilm during biological aging [2,3]. Although yeast cells typically die at the end of alcoholic fermentation due to sugar and oxygen depletion, biologically aged wines are transferred to barrels with an airspace that promotes oxidative growth and biofilm formation [3]. However, comparative studies suggest that not all Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains possess the capacity to form a velum, indicating that flor yeasts represent a specialized subset adapted to biofilm-associated growth during wine aging [3].
